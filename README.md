### CS396AL 

For assignment 6, we created random snakes. In accordance to assignment details, all joints contain motors and every pair of neurons contains synpases.

After cloning this repo, run the command "python search.py" in your terminal to see a new, random snake. 
Run the command everytime you wish to view a new snake. 

A brief video of the expected behavior can be found here: https://youtu.be/P2UvYyG3zeo

Below is an image of a (chunky) randomly generated snake:

The snake has blue and green links/parts. The blue indicates that the link does not contain sensors while the green indicates that the link does contain a sensor.

       This specific project (random snake generation) is not found on the ludobots subreddit but is course material from CS396 Artificial Life taught at Northwestern University by Professor Sam Kriegman. This class aims to contribute to the field of evolutionary robotics.
