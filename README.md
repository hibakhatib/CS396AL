# CS396AL 

For assignment 5, I created a hexapod. The torso is longer and the six legs are attached with three on each side. 
The fitness has not changed but I implemented "Marching to the beat" as described in Task O. 


To run this simulation locally, type the following command: "python search.py" in your terminal. 
It may take 5 or so minutes to run because there are several generations and a large population (these values can be adjusted in constants.py).
you may also see b3Warning messages. you can ignore these. 
The expected behavior can be found at this link: https://youtu.be/WdPl0X87KDU
